### Load packages and data

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox)
library(mosaicData) 
```

``` r
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 5 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr  (1): faculty_type
    ## dbl (11): 1975, 1989, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

### Exercise 1

``` r
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year") %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))

#plot long dataframe

staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = value,
             group = faculty_type,
             color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Instructional Staff Employment Plans", x = "Year", y = "Percentage of Hires", color = "Faculty Type")
```

### Exercise 2

This graph works, but given the question that we need to answer, I would
collapse the full-time faculty into one category so that there is less
clutter – and the visual can be assessed in terms of full time faculty
vs. part time faculty.

### Exercise 3

These visuals are truly horrendous: I cannot figure out what the
researchers are trying to convey. These are the changes I’d make:

-   Label which color on the plot represents fish captured vs. fish
    farmed in each country.

-   I’m not sure it makes sense to put both of these variables on the
    same graph, becuase the amount of fish farmed in China is so large,
    it makes it hard to tell anything else. So scaling things more
    appropriately for each variable would be useful.

-   On that note, it is really interesting to me that China alone farms
    more fish than the rest of the world combined. To highlight this,
    I’d like to make some sort of visual that compares China’s fish
    farming stats to that of every other country.

``` r
fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")

    ## Rows: 216 Columns: 4
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): country
    ## dbl (3): capture, aquaculture, total
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
#label for captured vs. farmed

fisheries %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = capture)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Total Fish Captured per Country", x = "Country", y = "Total Fish Captured")
